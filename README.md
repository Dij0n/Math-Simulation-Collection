# Processing Math/Physics Simulations

Above is a collection of the many Math and Physics simulations I made over the course of my learning through IB. From top to bottom they include:

- A Bezier Curve simulator
- A Camera that translates Image to Ascii in real time
- A Gear cycle simulator
- A PI Approximator using randomized placement and probability theory
- A Trigonometry Simulator
- A Unit Circle Simulator

These projects are fairly basic on their own and were fun 30 minute projects to work on as I learned Processing3
